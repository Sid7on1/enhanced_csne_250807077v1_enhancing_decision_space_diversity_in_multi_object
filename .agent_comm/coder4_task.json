Nascimento1, Ivan R. Meneghini1, Val\u00e9ria Santos1,\nEduardo Luz1and Gladston Moreira1\n1Computing Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, 35402-136, Minas Gerais, Brazil.\ngladston@ufop.edu.br\nABSTRACT\nMulti-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are essential for solving complex optimization\nproblems, such as the diet problem, where balancing conflicting objectives, like cost and nutritional\ncontent, is crucial. However, most MOEAs focus on optimizing solutions in the objective space,\noften neglecting the diversity of solutions in the decision space, which is critical for providing\ndecision-makers with a wide range of choices. This paper introduces an approach that directly\nintegrates a Hamming distance-based measure of uniformity into the selection mechanism of a\nMOEA to enhance decision space diversity. Experiments on a multi-objective formulation of the diet\nproblem demonstrate that our approach significantly improves decision space diversity compared to\nNSGA-II, while maintaining comparable objective space performance. The proposed method offers a\ngeneralizable strategy for integrating decision space awareness into MOEAs.\nKeywords Multi-objective optimization \u00b7Evolutionary algorithms \u00b7Decision space diversity \u00b7Hamming distance \u00b7\nDiet problem.\n1 Introduction\nThe growing emphasis on healthy lifestyles has increased the importance of optimizing food selection to meet nutritional\nneeds while minimizing cost and maximizing variety [ 1,2,3]. The diet problem, initially proposed by [ 4], captures\nthe core challenge of finding a cost-effective food combination that satisfies nutritional requirements. In real-world\nscenarios, the diet problem extends beyond cost minimization to include multiple conflicting objectives, such as\nmaximizing nutritional diversity and specific nutrient intake, posing a significant multi-objective optimization challenge\n[5,6,7]. The high dimensionality and combinatorial nature of the problem make finding a set of Pareto-optimal\nsolutions computationally intensive, necessitating efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [8].\nWhile MOEAs excel at exploring the objective space to approximate the Pareto front, they often overlook the importance\nof diversity in the decision space [ 9]. Offering a wide range of food combinations is crucial for effective diet planning,\nenabling decision-makers (e.g., nutritionists or individuals) to select solutions that best suit their personal preferences\nand constraints.\nThis paper addresses this gap by introducing the Dominance-Weight Hamming Distance (DWH) heuristic, a heuristic\nthat explicitly promotes decision space diversity, using a Hamming distance-based uniformity measure. The DWH\nheuristic extends the Dominance-Weighted Uniformity (DWU) approach in [ 9] for discrete multi-objective optimization\nproblems. We evaluate our approach on a multi-objective formulation of the diet problem, comparing it against the\nwell-established NSGA-II [ 10]. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in decision space diversity, as\nmeasured by the minimum and average Hamming distances, with comparable Hypervolume in the objective space. This\nsuggests that our method effectively explores a wider range of dietary options without compromising the quality of the\nsolutions in terms of cost, protein content, and variety. Our key contributions are:\n\u2022Integration of a Hamming distance-based uniformity measure into the selection process of a MOEA to enhance\ndecision space diversity;arXiv:2508.07077v1  [cs.NE]  9 Aug 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n\u2022A demonstration of the effectiveness of this approach in the context of the multi-objective diet problem, a\nchallenging real-world optimization problem;\n\u2022A quantitative comparison with NSGA-II, highlighting the trade-off between decision space diversity and\nobjective space performance.\nFuture work will explore the application of this approach to other multi-objective optimization problems and investigate\nalternative measures of decision space diversity.\n2 Related Work\nThe multi-objective diet problem has been addressed using various MOEAs and modeling techniques. In [ 11],\nthe authors use NSGA-II to generate personalized diets based on user characteristics, focusing on objective space\noptimization. A multi-objective model that minimizes cost, unhealthy fats, and sugar, while maximizing fiber intake, is\nproposed in [ 5]. Still, their approach uses scalarization methods, which are known to sometimes struggle with Pareto\nfront diversity.\nThe work in [ 6] presents an approach to the menu planning problem, specifically for school canteens. The approach\naims to minimize the cost of the menus and the repetition of courses and food groups. To solve this, the authors\nproposed a multi-objective memetic algorithm based on the MOEA/D framework.\nIn [12], the authors compared different MOEAs for school lunch planning, showing the effectiveness of NSGA-II and\nSPEA2 under different conditions. However, their analysis centers on objective space metrics, such as Hypervolume. A\nbi-level recommender system for food diets, utilizing NSGA-II at the higher level to determine the optimal combination\nof foods, is presented in [ 7]. The authors in [ 13] incorporated fuzzy inference to represent user preferences in the\nobjective function, showing the importance of personalized models.\nThe authors in [9] introduced a uniformity measure weighted by dominance for decision space diversity. However, its\nformulation aims to solve continuous multi-objective optimization problems.\nThis paper introduces the DWH heuristic, a heuristic based on the Hamming distance, which is more suitable for the\ndiscrete nature of the diet problem\u2019s decision variables (i.e., food choices).\n3 Background\n3.1 Problem Setting\nThe diet problem, in its basic form, aims to minimize the cost of a diet while satisfying nutritional requirements [ 4]. Let\nA={1,2, ..., n}be the set of navailable food items, and N={1,2, ..., m}be the set of messential nutrients. The\nclassical formulation, using linear programming, is:\nminimize f1(x) =nX\ni=1cixi (1)\nsubject to:\nnX\ni=1aijxi\u2265Rj,\u2200j\u2208N (2)\nxi\u22650,\u2200i\u2208A (3)\nwhere ciis the cost per serving of food item i,xiis the number of servings of food item i,aijis the amount of nutrient\njin food item i, andRjis the minimum required amount of nutrient j.\nIn this work, we extend this classical formulation to a multi-objective optimization problem over a 7-day period,\nconsidering the following objectives:\n1.Minimize Cost: f1as defined in Equation 1, extended over 7 days:\nf1(x) =7X\nd=1nX\ni=1cixid (4)\nwhere xidis the number of servings of food item ion day d.\n2\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n2.Minimize Repetitiveness: Following [ 12], we minimize the repetitiveness of food categories across days. Let\nG={1,2, ..., p}be the set of pfood categories. The repetitiveness penalty for day dis:\nvd=d\u22121X\nk=1 pX\ng=1ygkpg+zkpp+k!\n(5)\nwhere ygk= 1if category gis repeated on day d\u2212kand 0 otherwise, zk= 1if any category is repeated k\ndays before, and pgandpp+kare the repetition penalties (see Table 1). The overall repetitiveness objective is:\nf2(x) =7X\nd=1vd (6)\n3.Maximize Protein: We maximize the total protein content of the diet:\nf3(x) =7X\nd=1nX\ni=1uixid (7)\nwhere uiis the protein content per serving of food item i.\nThe multi-objective problem is then:\nminimize F(x) = (f1(x), f2(x),\u2212f3(x)) (8)\nsubject to:\nnX\ni=1aijxid\u2265Rj,\u2200j\u2208N,\u2200d\u2208 {1,2, ...,7} (9)\nxid\u22650,\u2200i\u2208A,\u2200d\u2208 {1,2, ...,7} (10)\nThis formulation presents a challenging multi-objective optimization problem with a large, complex search space. Our\napproach focuses on effectively exploring this space while maintaining diversity in the set of solutions.\nTable 1: Repetition penalties considered to minimize the repetitiveness of food categories across days.\nPenalty Description Value\np1 Repeat \u201cOther\u201d category 0.1\np2 Repeat \u201cMeats\u201d category 3\np3 Repeat \u201cCereals\u201d category 0.3\np4 Repeat \u201cFruits\u201d category 0.1\np5 Repeat \u201cDairy\u201d category 0.3\np6 Repeat \u201cLegumes\u201d category 0.3\np7 Repeat \u201cSeafood\u201d category 0.5\np8 Repeat \u201cVegetables\u201d category 0.1\np9 Repeat category 1 day before 3\np10 Repeat category 2 days before 2.5\np11 Repeat category 3 days before 1.8\np12 Repeat category 4 days before 1\np13 Repeat category 5 days before 0.2\np14 Repeat category 6 days before 0.1\n3.2 Dataset\nWe used the TACO dataset - (Brazilian Food Composition Table)[ 14], which provides nutritional information for 597\nfood items across 15 categories (see Table 2). Since the TACO dataset lacks cost information, we assigned random\ncosts between $1.00 and $10.00 to each food item. The nutritional requirements ( Rjin Equation (9)) were based on\nthe Brazilian Recommended Daily Intake values provided by ANVISA - (National Health Surveillance Agency in\nBrazil)[15].\n3\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\nTable 2: TACO dataset [14] composed of 15 Food Categories with 597 food items.\nCategory Number of Items\nCereals and derivatives 63\nVegetables, greens, and derivatives 99\nFruits and derivatives 96\nFats and oils 14\nfish and Seafood 50\nMeats and meat products 123\nMilk and dairy products 24\nAlcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages 14\nEggs and derivatives 7\nSugary products 20\nMiscellaneous 9\nOther processed foods 5\nPrepared food 32\nLegumes and derivatives 30\nNuts and seeds 11\n4 Method\nOur approach integrates a Hamming distance-based uniformity measure into the selection process of a multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm. The aim is to generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that are well-distributed in the objective\nspace and diverse in the decision space.\n4.1 Uniformity Measure based on Hamming Distance\nWe define a uniformity measure, wdH, that quantifies the dissimilarity between two diets based on their Hamming\ndistance. Given two diets DandD\u2032, represented by binary vectors xandx\u2032of length n(the number of food items),\nwdHis calculated as:\nwdH(x, x\u2032) =dH(x, x\u2032)\n|r(x)\u2212r(x\u2032)|+ 1(11)\nwhere dH(x, x\u2032)is the Hamming distance between the binary vectors representing the diets, defined by equation (13),\nandr(x)is the SPEA-2 raw fitness of solution x, as described in [ 16]. The denominator normalizes the Hamming\ndistance by the difference in fitness values, giving more weight to solutions that are dissimilar in the decision space and\nhave similar fitness. This measure is then incorporated into a MinMax heuristic, shown in Algorithm 1, to guide the\nselection process in the evolutionary algorithm.\n4.2 Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Hamming Diversity (MOEA-HD)\nOur MOEA-HD algorithm follows a standard evolutionary algorithm framework with modifications to the selection\nprocess to incorporate the wdHmeasure. A solution is represented as a matrix of size n\u00d77, where nis the number of\nfood items, and each element (i, d)represents the number of servings of food item ion day d. The algorithm proceeds\nas follows:\n1.Initialization: Generate an initial population P0ofkindividuals (diets) randomly. Apply a repair operator to\nensure all individuals satisfy the nutritional constraints (Equation 9).\n2.Iteration: Fort= 0tomax _gen:\n(a)Fitness Assignment: Calculate the fitness of each individual in Ptusing Non-dominated Sorting as in\nNSGA-II [10].\n(b)Selection: Perform kbinary tournaments. The winner of each tournament is determined by:\n\u2022 If one solution is feasible and the other is not, the feasible solution wins.\n\u2022 If both are infeasible, the solution with the lower constraint violation penalty (Equation 12) wins.\n\u2022If both are feasible, the solution that maximizes wdHwith respect to other selected solutions wins\n(using Algorithm 1).\n4\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n(c)Crossover: Apply multi-point crossover (20 points) on selected pairs to generate offspring.\n(d)Mutation: Apply bit-flip mutation to the offspring.\n(e)Population Update: Combine Ptand the offspring, and use Algorithm 1 to select the kindividuals for\nPt+1.\n3.Final Repair: Apply the repair operator to the individuals in the final population Pmax _gen.\n4.Output: Return the non-dominated solutions from Pmax _gen.\nAlgorithm 1 DWH Heuristic for Diversity Selection\nRequire: Population P, scalar k\nEnsure: Set of diverse solutions R\n1:NP\u2190Non-dominated solutions of P\n2:R\u2190arg max x,x\u2032\u2208NPwdH(x, x\u2032)\n3:while|R|< kdo\n4:x\u2032\u2190arg max x\u2208P\\Rminr\u2208RwdH(x, r)\n5:R\u2190R\u222a {x\u2032}\n6:return R\n4.3 Constraint Handling\nSolutions that violate the nutritional constraints (Equation 9) are penalized. The penalty is calculated as the sum of the\ndeficits for each nutrient and day:\npenalty =7X\nd=1mX\nj=1max(0 , Rj\u2212aijxid) (12)\nThis penalty is used in the selection process to favor feasible solutions and to differentiate between infeasible solutions.\n5 Experimental Setup\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our MOEA-HD, we compared its performance with that of NSGA-II [ 10], a widely used\nand effective multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Both algorithms were implemented in Python, and experiments\nwere conducted on a machine equipped with a Ryzen 5 2600 processor and 16GB of RAM.\n5.1 Hamming Distance\nThe Hamming distance [ 17] is a metric used to measure the difference between two binary strings. Given two strings of\nequal length, the Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols differ. Formally,\ngiven two binary strings a=a1a2. . . a nandb=b1b2. . . bn, with ai, bj\u2208 {0,1}, i, j = 1,2, . . . n , the Hamming\ndistance dHbetween aandbis:\ndH(a, b) =nX\ni=1|ai\u2212bi| (13)\nIn this work we will represent the string x=x1x2, . . . x nas a binary vector x= (x1, x2, . . . , x n), xi\u2208 {0,1}, i=\n1,2, . . . n . Furthermore, we represent each diet as a binary vector where each element indicates the presence or absence\nof a particular food item. The Hamming distance then measures how different two diets are in terms of their food\ncomposition.\n5.2 Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we use two sets of metrics:\n5.2.1 Objective Space Metric\n\u2022Hypervolume: This metric measures the region\u2019s volume in the objective space dominated by the non-\ndominated solutions and bounded by a reference point [ 18]. A higher hypervolume generally indicates a better\napproximation of the Pareto front.\n5\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n5.2.2 Decision Space Metrics\n\u2022dHmin : The minimum Hamming distance between any two solutions in the non-dominated set. This metric\nreflects the closeness of the most similar solutions; a higher value indicates better diversity.\ndHmin =min(dH(x, x\u2032)) (14)\n\u2022dHmed : The average Hamming distance between all pairs of solutions in the non-dominated set. This provides\nan overall measure of diversity in the decision space; a higher value is desirable.\ndHmed =P\nx\u2032\u2208DP\nx\u2208DdH(x, x\u2032)\n|D|2(15)\n5.3 Parameters\nThe parameters for both algorithms were:\n\u2022 Population size: 30\n\u2022Initialization: Food quantities were randomly initialized with a weighted distribution (94% chance of 0, 4% of\n1, 1% of 2 servings).\n\u2022 Maximum generations: 30, 100, 300\n\u2022 Crossover: 20-point multi-point crossover\n\u2022 Mutation: Bit-flip with 5% probability for 1-to-0 and 0.16% for 0-to-1 flips.\nFor each algorithm, we run it 30 times for each generation setting, and the average results were recorded. Hypervolume\nwas calculated using a reference point based on the worst-case objective values, and the objective values were normalized\nprior to hypervolume calculation.\n6 Results and Discussion\n6.1 Performance metrics\nTable 3 presents the comparative results of MOEA-HD and NSGA-II. The key observation is that MOEA-HD consis-\ntently outperforms NSGA-II in decision space diversity metrics 5.2.2. This confirms our hypothesis that incorporating\nHamming distance into the selection process effectively promotes the generation of more diverse dietary solutions.\nTable 3: Hypervolume, minimum and average Hamming distances of the solutions obtained by the MOEA-HD and\nNSGA-II algorithms.\nGenerationsMOEA-HD NSGA-II\nHv dHmin dHmed Hv dHmin dHmed\n30 0.379 95.03 184.77 0.446 43.30 157.90\n100 0.387 87.90 159.91 0.412 32.86 121.30\n300 0.389 90.46 154.39 0.381 26.56 108.82\nSpecifically, at 30 generations, the minimum Hamming distance dHmin for MOEA-HD is 95.03, compared to 43.30 for\nNSGA-II. This indicates that even the most similar solutions generated by MOEA-HD are significantly more different\nthan those generated by NSGA-II. The average Hamming distance dHmed also exhibits a similar trend, with MOEA-HD\nachieving higher values, which confirms greater overall diversity. Importantly, this enhanced diversity in the decision\nspace is achieved without a significant compromise in objective space performance, as the hypervolume values are\ncomparable between the two algorithms.\n6.2 Objective space\nFigure 1 visually compares the Pareto front approximations obtained by both algorithms after 100 generations. While\nboth algorithms cover a similar region in the objective space, the solutions generated by MOEA-HD appear to be more\nevenly distributed, as reflected in the quantitative diversity measures.\n6\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n60070080090010001100\nCost\n100110120130140\nDiversity350040004500500055006000\nProtein\n(a) MOEA-HD algorithm.\n450500550600650700750800850\nCost\n100105110115120125130135\nDiversity30003500400045005000\nProtein\n (b) NSGA-II algorithm.\nFigure 1: Pareto front approximations for Maximum generations = 300 for: (a) MOEA-HD algorithm; (b) NSGA-II\nalgorithm.\n6.3 Decision space\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate the diets proposed by the algorithms. In each figure, the points in the decision space of one\nexecution of each algorithm are grouped according to the categories presented in Table 2. Figure 2 illustrates the weekly\nconsumption of the items, while Figure 3 presents the diets proposed for each day of the week.\nThe comparison of Figures 2a and 2b shows that the MOEA-HD algorithm reduced the consumption of the item meat\nand meat products and increased the consumption of fish and seafood . An increase in demand for the item fruits and\nderivatives and the item vegetables, greens and derivatives is also observed in the response presented by the MOEA-HD\nalgorithm. There was also a slight reduction in sugary products ,milk and dairy products , and prepared foods . The\ndemand for processed food was eliminated. No significant variation in the quantity of the items fats and oils ,eggs and\nderivatives , and vegetables and derivatives was observed. The observed variations can facilitate the purchasing process\nby presenting a more diversified shopping list, thereby reducing the impact of potential supply restrictions on specific\nitems. In addition, a more diversified demand allows the decision maker to purchase items that are more abundant at\ncertain times of the year, resulting in cost savings.\nThe use of items on the days of the week, shown in Figures 3a and 3b, also reveals important details. Initially, a more\neven distribution of item consumption is observed during a week, as indicated by the greater regularity in the height of\nthe bars in each graph. There is an offer of animal protein (meat or fish) on all days of the week in the diets proposed by\nthe MOEA-HD algorithm, while this item is absent on Wednesdays in all diets proposed by the NSGA-II algorithm.\nAnother important aspect is the increase in dietary diversity proposed by the MOEA-HD algorithm, particularly on\nweekends, such as Saturdays and Sundays.\nIn general, figures 2 and 3 show that the diversification of solutions in the decision space increased the quality of the\nproposed solutions, both from a financial and nutritional point of view.\n6.4 Statistical validation\nWe performed a Monte Carlo simulation to further validate our results\u2019 statistical significance. For each performance\nmetric (Hypervolume, dHmin , anddHmed ) and each generation setting, we generated 5000 random permutations of the\ncombined results from both algorithms. We calculated the difference in means for each permutation. This allowed us to\nconstruct a distribution of mean differences under the null hypothesis that no significant difference exists between the\nalgorithms. We then compared the observed mean difference to this distribution to assess its statistical significance.\nThe results of the Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6. For Hypervolume (Figure 5), the observed\nmean differences are not statistically significant, indicating that both algorithms achieve comparable objective space\nperformance. However, for dHmin (Figure 6) and dHmed (Figure 4), the observed differences are highly significant\n(p <0.01) across all generation settings, strongly supporting the superiority of MOEA-HD in terms of decision space\ndiversity.\n7\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nWeekly consumptionLegumes and derivativesOther processed foodsPrepared foodVegetables, greens and derivativesalcoholic and non-alcoholic beveragescereals and derivativeseggs and derivativesfats and oils\ufb01sh and seafoodfruits and derivativesmeat and meat productsmilk and dairy productsmiscellaneoussugary productsWeekly consumption proposed by MOEA-HD\nSun\nMon\nTue\nWed\nThu\nFri\nSat\n(a) Items demanded by the MOEA-HD algorithm.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nWeekly consumptionLegumes and derivativesOther processed foodsPrepared foodVegetables, greens and derivativesalcoholic and non-alcoholic beveragescereals and derivativeseggs and derivativesfats and oils\ufb01sh and seafoodfruits and derivativesmeat and meat productsmilk and dairy productsmiscellaneoussugary productsWeekly consumption proposed by NSGA-II\nSun\nMon\nTue\nWed\nThu\nFri\nSat\n(b) Items demanded by the NSGA-II algorithm.\nFigure 2: Weekly consumption of the items proposed by the algorithms.\nThese results highlight a crucial trade-off in multi-objective optimization. While NSGA-II excels at converging to a\nwell-performing Pareto front in the objective space, it may sacrifice diversity in the solutions. In contrast, MOEA-HD\nprioritizes exploring a wider range of solutions, providing decision-makers with more options, which can be particularly\nvaluable in real-world applications, such as personalized diet planning.\n6.5 Limitations\nThe limitations of our study include the use of randomly generated costs for food items, which may not accurately\nreflect actual price variations in the real world. Future work should incorporate more realistic cost data and explore the\nimpact of different diversity measures and selection strategies.\n8\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\nSun\nMon\nTue\nWed\nThu\nFri\nSat\nweekday01020304050Items per categoryDiet proposed by MOEA-HD\nLegumes and derivatives\nOther processed foods\nPrepared food\nVegetables, greens and derivatives\nalcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages\ncereals and derivatives\neggs and derivatives\nfats and oils\n\ufb01sh and seafood\nfruits and derivatives\nmeat and meat products\nmilk and dairy products\nmiscellaneous\nsugary products\n(a) Items on the days of the week obtained by the MOEA-HD algorithm.\nSun\nMon\nTue\nWed\nThu\nFri\nSat\nweekday01020304050Items per categoryDiet proposed by NSGA-II\nLegumes and derivatives\nOther processed foods\nPrepared food\nVegetables, greens and derivatives\nalcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages\ncereals and derivatives\neggs and derivatives\nfats and oils\n\ufb01sh and seafood\nfruits and derivatives\nmeat and meat products\nmilk and dairy products\nmiscellaneous\nsugary products\n(b) Items on the days of the week obtained by the NSGA-II algorithm.\nFigure 3: Diets proposed for each day of the week.\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper presented MOEA-HD, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that enhances decision space diversity\nby integrating a Hamming distance-based uniformity measure into its selection mechanism. Experiments on a multi-\nobjective formulation of the diet problem demonstrated that MOEA-HD significantly outperforms NSGA-II in terms of\ndecision space diversity, while maintaining comparable objective space performance. Additionally, demonstrate that the\ndiversification of solutions in the decision space enhances the quality of the proposed solutions, both from a financial\nand nutritional perspective. This suggests that MOEA-HD is a valuable tool for applications where providing diverse\nsolutions is crucial for decision-making. Future work will extend this approach to other multi-objective optimization\nproblems and explore alternative diversity measures.\n9\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nEnhancing Decision Space Diversity in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for the Diet Problem\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n10\n20\nDi\ufb00erence between population averages\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200Frequency\ndHmed\nObserved di\ufb00erence\nFigure 4: Monte Carlo simulation for dHmed after 300 generations.
